#### Overview

CS50 is Harvard University's premier introductory course to Computer Science, led by Professor David J. Malan. This foundational course serves as a comprehensive entry point into the world of computing, covering essential concepts and practical programming skills.

#### Course Components

The course curriculum encompasses several key areas that form the backbone of computer science education:

#### Computer Science Fundamentals

The course begins with core theoretical concepts that underpin all of computing:

* **Abstraction** - Learning to manage complexity by hiding implementation details
* **Algorithms** - Studying systematic problem-solving approaches and their efficiency 
* **Data Structures** - Understanding how to organize and manage data effectively
* **Encapsulation** - Mastering the principle of bundling data with methods that operate on that data
* **Resource Management** - Learning how to efficiently utilize computer resources like memory and processing power

#### Security & Engineering Practices 

Modern software development requires a strong foundation in:

* **Software Engineering Principles** - Best practices for writing maintainable, scalable code
* **Security Concepts** - Understanding common vulnerabilities and how to protect against them
* **Web Development Fundamentals** - Learning how to build secure and efficient web applications

#### Programming Languages

Throughout the course, you'll gain hands-on experience with multiple programming languages:

* **C** - Understanding low-level programming and memory management
* **Python** - Learning high-level programming and rapid development
* **SQL** - Mastering database management and queries
* **JavaScript** - Creating interactive web experiences  
* **HTML & CSS** - Building structured and styled web content

#### Getting Started

Week 1 marks the beginning of our journey with C programming, establishing a strong foundation in programming concepts and computational thinking. This module introduces:

#### Core Concepts

* **Basic Syntax and Program Structure**
  - Understanding how to write and organize C programs
  - Learning the rules and conventions of the C language

* **Variables and Data Types**
  - Working with integers, floats, and characters
  - Understanding type conversion and limitations

* **Control Flow and Conditional Statements**
  - Mastering if-else conditions
  - Implementing loops and switches 
  - Understanding program execution flow

* **Functions and Memory Management**
  - Creating and using functions
  - Understanding stack vs heap memory
  - Managing memory allocation and deallocation

> **Info:** This workshop is adapted from Harvard's CS50 curriculum and optimized for an AWS learning environment. All content is designed to align with CS50's academic standards while providing practical applications in cloud computing contexts.

#### Next Steps

After completing this introduction, you'll be ready to:

1. Set up your development environment
2. Write your first C program
3. Begin exploring fundamental programming concepts  
4. Start thinking computationally about problem-solving
